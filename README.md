I created this to-do list manager to practice my JS knowledge in practice.

In it you can:

- add a new task
- edit a task
- delete a task
- sort by status
- search for tasks by name
- change the theme from light to dark and vice versa

Of course, there is still a lot of work to be done, but I am happy to be able to
create such simple but working services
